**Data Source:**

The project utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on user input or device location.

**Project Structure:**

The website consists of three main files:

1. **index.html:** Defines the HTML layout of the webpage elements.
2. **style.css:** Contains CSS styles for visual design and formatting.
3. **script.js:** Implements JavaScript code for functionality:
    * Retrieves user-entered city name.
    * Sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name.
    * Handles "Get Device Location" button click:
        * Checks for browser geolocation support.
        * If supported, retrieves user's device location (latitude & longitude).
        * Sends coordinates to the OpenWeatherMap API.
    * Processes response data from the API and populates relevant HTML elements.
    * Displays weather icons based on weather conditions using the API's provided ID.
